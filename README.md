# Titanic Survival Predictive Modeling

Welcome to the "Titanic Survival Predictive Modeling" project repository! This project focuses on predicting passenger survival on the Titanic using various machine learning models. The goal is to build a predictive model that can accurately classify passengers as survivors or non-survivors based on available features.

## Project Overview

The primary objective of this project is to create a predictive model for Titanic passenger survival. The project consists of the following key components:

1. **Data Exploration:** In this stage, we explore the Titanic dataset to understand its characteristics and features. We aim to gain insights into the passengers' attributes and their survival outcomes.

2. **Data Preprocessing:** Data preprocessing involves tasks such as handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and preparing the dataset for modeling.

3. **Predictive Modeling:** We apply various machine learning models, such as Logistic Regression, Decision Tree Classifier, and Gradient Boosting Classifier, to predict passenger survival.

4. **Model Evaluation:** The effectiveness of each predictive model is evaluated, and we assess their performance using relevant metrics.

5. **Submission File:** We generate a prediction file (`Titanic_prediction.csv`) for submission to the Kaggle competition.

## Repository Structure

The repository is structured as follows:

```
Titanic-Survival-Predictive-Modeling/
├── data/
│ ├── Titanic_train.csv
│ ├── Titanic_test.csv
│ └── ...
├── notebooks/
│ ├── Titanic_Working_File.ipynb
│ └── ...
├── README.md
└── .gitignore

```

- The `data/` directory contains the Titanic dataset, split into training and test sets (`Titanic_train.csv` and `Titanic_test.csv`).

- The `notebooks/` directory includes the Jupyter notebook `Titanic_Working_File.ipynb`, where different predictive models are applied and evaluated.

## Getting Started

To get started with the project, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository:** Use the following command to clone the repository to your local machine:
git clone
```shell
        https://github.com/MTalhaZafar32/CodSoft-Titanic-Survival-Predictive-Modeling/.git
```

2. **Install Dependencies:** Ensure you have the necessary Python libraries installed. You can typically install them using `pip`.

3. **Explore the Data:** Navigate to the `data/` directory to find the Titanic dataset files (`Titanic_train.csv` and `Titanic_test.csv`).

4. **Notebook Analysis:** Open the `notebooks/Titanic_Working_File.ipynb` notebook to view the analysis and application of different predictive models for Titanic passenger survival.

## Data Files

- `Titanic_train.csv`: The training dataset containing information about Titanic passengers, used for model training and evaluation.

- `Titanic_test.csv`: The test dataset for which you will make predictions and create the submission file.
